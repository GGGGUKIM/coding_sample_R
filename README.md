The following document is my essay for the Intro to Data Science course at Georgetown. This essay uses survey data and data science techniques to predict whether a Chinese trusts the local government or not. In addition to model building, this essay involves reviewing relevant literature, data cleaning and processing, descriptive analysis, data visualization, and explanations of the logic for each model. Figures and tables are attached in the appendix at the end of formal writing. This pdf document is written by using R Markdown. The essay is my own work.
